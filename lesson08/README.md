# :earth_americas: Lesson 08

## WebHooked

Until now, we've been _reading_ data from GitHub, which is great, but we can do a lot more than that :muscle:

In this lesson, we'll _write_ some data to GitHub via the API, thereby _enhancing_ the default GitHub behavior. We'll also get and up running with a real, live WebHook example, an important component of the GitHub platform, and a crucial part of being successful with the GitHub API.

### Lessons

1. Unveiling the (currently in preview) branch protection API
2. Preparing for WebHooks with a simple Sinatra server
3. Exposing our Sinatra server to the interwebs
4. Putting it all together
