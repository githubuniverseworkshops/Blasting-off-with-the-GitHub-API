# :earth_americas: Lesson 02

## Diving a little deeper

In which we'll explore the API some more, but this time from the command line.

### Lessons
- Using [curl](https://curl.haxx.se/), everybody's favorite command-line tool for communicating with a url (pre-installed on most systems, available on Windows after an install of GitHub Desktop)
- Some other favorite command line tools of ours are:
    1. [httpie](http://httpie.org), a user friendly replacement for curl
        - `http https://api.github.com/users/octocat`
        - Note, syntax highlighting, headers included by default
    1. [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/), amazingly useful tool for *processing* JSON from the command-line
